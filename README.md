### Hi there ðŸ‘‹




I am a Front-end Developer . I got Professional experience with the technologies listed in the **toolbox** below.

I create website and videos, **but** I also write poems and some stories.

I managed to create an online presence with my [Portfolio](https://amedeebaptiste.com) and my [YouTube] channel, which will be available soon. Looking forward to reaching and working with more people.
